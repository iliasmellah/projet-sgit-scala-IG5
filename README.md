# projet-sgit-scala-IG5

This is a school project that aims to create a git-like named "Sgit".

My project is composed of several files and directories. In order to be able to run it, you need to have :
 - scala (version  2.13.1)

Then clone this project. After that, you need to go into the cloned project root, run sbt compile and then sbt run.
